The beloved Cuberunner is back, now in an enhanced edition! Get ready for an exciting and fast-paced minigame that's based on the classic Cuberunner, but with enhanced features and improvements for the latest Minecraft version.

### Features:

- **Enhanced Gameplay**: Experience Cuberunner like never before with improved mechanics, controls, and challenges that will test your skills and reflexes to the max.

- **New Levels and Obstacles**: Navigate through an array of new levels and face challenging obstacles that will push you to the limits.

- **Power-ups and Power-downs**: Collect power-ups and power-downs to boost or hinder your abilities. Choose from a variety of power-ups like JumpBoost or SpeedBoost to gain temporary advantages, or power-downs like SlowDown or Restriction to increase the challenge.

- **Team Support**: Play with friends in multiplayer mode and compete for the top spot on the leaderboards. Form teams of 2 or 3 players (configurable up to 5 players) and start with 5 lives (Respawn Tokens) (configurable) displayed on the scoreboard. When a player dies, one life is deducted, but they respawn in the air (losing their current power-up or power-down). If a team runs out of lives, they are eliminated regardless of remaining players' lives.

- **Survival Mode**: Don't have friends? No problem! Just play the SinglePlayer Mode and try to survive as long as possible. Test your skills and compete against yourself to beat your own high score.

- **Customization Options**: Customize your game settings, skins, and more to make your Cuberunner experience truly your own. Purchase custom sand or cement colors with in-game currency or real money to create unique color combinations and personalize your gameplay.

- **Regular Updates**: Expect regular updates with new content, bug fixes, and optimizations to keep the game fresh and exciting.
